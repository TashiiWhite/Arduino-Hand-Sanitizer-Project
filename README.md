# Arduino-Hand-Sanitizer-Project
Arduino hand sanitizer that dispenses sanitizer using a servo and motion sensor

required parts: 
1. Arduino
2. Ultrasonic sensor
3. use servo
4. bread board
5. 3D printed parts

The servo should respond to the Ultrasonic sensor input , and perform a 180 degree rotation to slide the support arm and squeeze out sanitizer from the neck of the sanitizer bottle.
